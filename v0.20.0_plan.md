# v0.20.0 Plan

## Goals
- Add a City Watch seat that can issue time-bound warrants to intensify the bounty loop.
- Surface warrant status across the dashboard, institutions, and player list.
- Clarify contract travel lockouts in the UI.

## Plan
1. Introduce warrant state, seat actions, and bounty reward bonuses for warranted targets.
2. Update Institutions, Players, and Standing UI to display warrants and new seat controls.
3. Add tests for warrant issuance/expiry, update release notes, and bump version.

## Review Checklist
- Commanders can issue warrants, which expire and boost bounty rewards.
- Institutions panel lists active warrants and provides the issue action with high-impact gating.
- Standing/players/contract views show warrant status and travel lockouts clearly.
