# v0.19.0 Plan

## Goals
- Add sealed missives to diplomacy with a gold cost and visible seal indicators.
- Make courier intercepts respect seals with lower success chances and redacted intel.
- Fix high-impact budgeting on exposure threats when evidence is missing.

## Plan
1. Extend diplomatic and intercept models to track sealed status and build redacted intel views.
2. Update diplomacy UI and message handling to support sealing with cost checks.
3. Adjust intercept logic for sealed penalties, add tests, and update release notes/version.

## Review Checklist
- Sealed missives cost gold, display seal tags, and keep content private for interceptors.
- Intercept success is reduced for sealed messages and intel shows redacted content.
- Threaten exposure no longer consumes high-impact budget without evidence.
