# v0.8.0 Plan

## Goal
Introduce a diplomacy mailbox for private missives so players can coordinate deals and political moves outside global chat.

## Scope
- Add diplomatic message storage with cooldowns and sender/recipient delivery.
- Create a Diplomacy panel with compose form and recent missives list.
- Ensure private messages stay visible only to sender/recipient.
- Add toast notifications for new courier arrivals.
- UX polish: align institutions toggle labels with dashboard wording.
- Tests for diplomacy delivery privacy and new fragment polling.

## Non-Goals
- No treaties, contracts, or mechanical bonuses tied to messages.
- No message threading or read receipts.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add diplomacy message models, storage, and helper functions.
2. Wire /message and /frag/diplomacy endpoints with cooldown and validation.
3. Add Diplomacy fragment and dashboard polling update.
4. Update templates and styles for the new panel.
5. Adjust institutions toggle labels for clarity.
6. Add HTTP tests for diplomacy visibility and fragment polling.

## Review Notes
- Confirm cooldown and validation prevent empty or oversized messages.
- Verify only participants can see missives.
- Ensure dashboard OOB updates include diplomacy panel.
