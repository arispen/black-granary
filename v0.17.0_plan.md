# v0.17.0 Plan

## Goals
- Give the High Curate a seat power that counters forged evidence and rumor waves.
- Surface the inquest action in Institutions/Offices with high-impact budgeting context.
- Add test coverage for inquest behavior and update release notes.

## Plan
1. Add the High Curate inquest action to purge forged evidence, dampen rumors, and adjust standing.
2. Update seat views and templates to show the Conduct Inquest action for the seat holder.
3. Add tests for inquest effects, update release notes, bump version to 0.17.0.

## Review Checklist
- Inquest requires the High Curate seat and consumes high-impact budget.
- Forged evidence is removed while legitimate evidence remains.
- Rumor credibility/spread/decay are reduced and the action appears in the UI.
