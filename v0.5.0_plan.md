# v0.5.0 Plan — Player Supply Contracts

## Goals
- Let players post supply contracts with escrowed gold rewards.
- Require grain stockpiles to fulfill supply deliveries.
- Surface issuer, reward, and requirements in the contracts UI.

## Scope
1. Supply contract posting with reward escrow and sack requirements.
2. Contract acceptance restrictions (no self-accept) and delivery using stockpiled grain.
3. Supply contract expiry refunding part of escrow.
4. UI updates: issuer, reward notes, requirement notes, and withdrawal for issuers.

## Out of Scope
- Multi-city delivery routes or travel time.
- Contract negotiation, counter-offers, or player-issued bounties.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Reward farming via self-acceptance.
  - Block accepting your own supply contracts.
- Stale supply contracts clutter the board.
  - Deadline ticks with partial escrow refunds on expiry.

## Release Checklist
- Update release notes.
- Bump VERSION to 0.5.0.
- Tests pass.
- Tag v0.5.0 and merge with master.
