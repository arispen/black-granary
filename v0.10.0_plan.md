# v0.10.0 Plan

## Goal
Introduce a lightweight location/travel loop and fieldwork actions to make time and geography matter in the city.

## Scope
- Add player locations with travel timers between four districts (capital, harbor, frontier, ruins).
- Surface travel status + destination selector on the dashboard.
- Add location-gated fieldwork actions (frontier scavenging, ruins exploration) with cooldowns and rewards/risks.
- Show fieldwork availability/cooldowns in the UI and block actions while traveling.
- UX polish: show high-impact remaining in Institutions and cap rumor claim length.
- Tests for travel progress, travel action blocking, and a deterministic ruins outcome.

## Non-Goals
- No multi-city world map or route-based market pricing.
- No equipment/inventory, combat, or map visuals.
- No NPC factions tied to new locations yet.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add location definitions, travel timers, and per-player travel state.
2. Wire travel tick processing into world ticks and guard actions during travel.
3. Implement fieldwork actions with cooldown checks and outcomes.
4. Update dashboard UI for travel/fieldwork and institutions/intel UX polish.
5. Add tests covering travel progress, action blocking, and fieldwork outcome.

## Review Notes
- Confirm travel arrival events clear travel state and notify the player.
- Ensure fieldwork cooldowns and supply costs apply correctly.
- Verify travel/fieldwork UI updates on dashboard refreshes.
