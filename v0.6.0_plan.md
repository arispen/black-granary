# v0.6.0 Plan

## Goal
Make obligations a real leverage loop: overdue favors bite, and players can settle or forgive them.

## Scope
- Add obligation cost + settlement flow (gold transfer, rep/heat shifts).
- Add forgiveness flow for creditors.
- Apply overdue penalties on finance ticks and surface status in the ledger.
- UI: show obligation cost and action buttons with disabled-state messaging.
- Tests for overdue processing + settlement.

## Non-Goals
- No new obligation creation sources beyond existing actions.
- No multi-step enforcement chains or collections beyond settle/forgive.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add obligation cost helper + due tick constant; expose cost/actions in `ObligationView`.
2. Process overdue obligations in finance tick, apply penalties + events.
3. Add action handlers for `settle_obligation` and `forgive_obligation`.
4. Update ledger UI to show costs and action buttons.
5. Add tests for overdue + settlement.

## Review Notes
- Ensure costs scale with severity and remain affordable (3g-20g).
- Verify that overdue penalties apply once, not every tick.
- Confirm UI disables settle when gold is insufficient.
