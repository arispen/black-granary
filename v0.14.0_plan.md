# v0.14.0 Plan

## Goals
- Add a new civic project that temporarily dampens intel pressure via warded lanterns.
- Surface ward status in institutions/intel and reduce confusion during travel lockouts.

## Plan
1. Add ward network state to the world, with tick-down handling and expiry messaging.
2. Introduce the Ward Lanterns public works project that sets ward duration on completion.
3. Apply ward effects: slow rumor spread/decay faster, reduce scrying success chances.
4. UX polish: show ward status and disable intel/ledger/institution actions while traveling.
5. Update release notes and bump version to 0.14.0.

## Review Checklist
- Ward network ticks down each world tick and clears with a notification.
- Ward Lanterns project grants ward duration on completion.
- Rumor spread/decay and scry chances change as expected under wards.
- UI reflects travel lockouts and ward status consistently.
