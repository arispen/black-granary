# v0.16.0 Plan

## Goals
- Add a forged evidence intel action that creates short-lived dossiers with risk.
- Surface evidence origin in the Intel panel and clarify expiry timing.
- Include UI clarity around when forging is blocked.

## Plan
1. Extend evidence storage with an origin flag and forge action flow (cost, cooldown, success chance, penalties).
2. Update Intel UI to include forge controls and show evidence origin + expiry ticks.
3. Add tests for forged evidence success/failure, update release notes, bump version to 0.16.0.

## Review Checklist
- Forged evidence respects intel cooldowns, high-impact caps, and costs gold.
- Forgery failures penalize reputation and heat without adding evidence.
- Intel panel shows evidence origin and expiry in ticks.
