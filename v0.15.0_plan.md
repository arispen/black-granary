# v0.15.0 Plan

## Goals
- Introduce courier intercept intel action with short-lived intercepted missives.
- Surface intercepted missives in the Intel panel and tighten travel/lockout UX.

## Plan
1. Add intercept storage, expiry handling, and helper to pull recent courier traffic.
2. Implement the intercept courier action with high-impact budget and ward penalties.
3. Update Intel UI to include intercept actions/logs and disable market inputs when actions are locked.
4. Add tests, update release notes, and bump version to 0.15.0.

## Review Checklist
- Intercept courier consumes high-impact budget and respects cooldowns.
- Intercepted missives expire after the configured tick window.
- Intel panel shows intercepted missives with expiry.
- Market amount inputs are disabled when trading is locked out.
