# v0.9.0 Plan

## Goal
Introduce citywide crisis events that apply ongoing pressure and give players a high-impact response action.

## Scope
- Add crisis definitions (plague, fire, collapse) with tick-based unrest/grain pressure.
- Spawn a single active crisis based on unrest/grain conditions.
- Add a response action that consumes gold/grain + high-impact budget to mitigate crises.
- Add a Crisis Watch card on the dashboard with status and response controls.
- UX polish: clarify permit/embargo toggle labels and impact counters.
- Tests for crisis response and crisis tick pressure.

## Non-Goals
- No multi-crisis stacking or faction-specific crisis chains.
- No new contract types tied to crises.
- No persistent injuries or player deaths.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add crisis data structures, definitions, and tick/resolve helpers.
2. Wire crisis processing into world ticks and response action handling.
3. Add Crisis Watch UI and response gating logic.
4. Apply UX label polish for permit/embargo toggles and impact counters.
5. Add tests for crisis response resolution and pressure application.

## Review Notes
- Verify crisis tick effects clamp unrest and update grain tiers.
- Ensure response action respects high-impact budget and resource costs.
- Confirm crisis UI disables response when unavailable and updates on actions.
