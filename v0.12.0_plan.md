# v0.12.0 Plan

## Goal
Introduce a relic recovery loop from the Haunted Ruins, with Temple appraisals and one-time relic invocations.

## Scope
- Add relic inventory records with appraisal state and effect metadata.
- Ruins fieldwork can recover sealed relics instead of straight gold payouts.
- Appraise relics in the Capital for gold to reveal effects.
- Invoke appraised relics for one-time bonuses (rep/heat/gold/rumors/grain).
- UI: add Relics card showing status, effects, and actions.
- UX: clarify travel lockouts and pause market actions while traveling.
- Tests for appraisal + invocation flow.

## Non-Goals
- No relic trading, auctions, or permanent equipment slots.
- No multi-city temple variants or faction-specific relic tiers.
- No new ruin locations or combat encounters.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add relic models, store tracking, and definition helpers.
2. Wire ruins fieldwork to create relics and log events/toasts.
3. Implement appraisal + invocation actions with Temple/Capital gating.
4. Render relic inventory in the dashboard with action states.
5. Add relic tests and tighten travel UX notes/market disable.

## Review Notes
- Ensure relics are removed after invocation and cannot be double-used.
- Confirm appraisals require Capital location and deduct gold.
- Verify traveling disables market actions and relic actions gracefully.
