# v0.7.0 Plan

## Goal
Introduce public works projects as a time-bound civic investment loop that affects grain, unrest, reputation, and heat.

## Scope
- Add project definitions, storage, and tick processing.
- Allow players to fund one active project at a time (city-wide cap enforced).
- Surface active projects and funding options in Institutions.
- Apply project completion effects and events.
- UX fixes for intel action cooldowns/high-impact caps.
- Tests for project launch + completion effects.

## Non-Goals
- No multi-stage project upgrades or branching outcomes.
- No NPC-driven projects or automatic funding.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add project models, definitions, and helper functions.
2. Process project ticks and apply completion effects + events.
3. Add project launch action + data plumbing.
4. Update Institutions UI with active projects and funding forms.
5. Fix intel action disable states for cooldown and high-impact caps.
6. Add tests for project launch + completion.

## Review Notes
- Ensure project costs and effects are modest relative to market/contract economy.
- Verify project caps prevent spam and daily high-impact budget is respected.
- Confirm UI clearly shows costs, duration, and disabled reasons.
