# v0.11.0 Plan

## Goal
Make emergency permits a tangible institution lever by letting the Harbor Master grant timed access and by surfacing permit status in the UI.

## Scope
- Add permit state with tick-based expiry and event logging.
- Allow the Harbor Master to issue permits when emergency permits are required.
- Allow low-rep players to accept emergency contracts if they hold an active permit.
- Surface permit status in the standing summary and show active permits in Institutions.
- UX polish: disable emergency contract acceptance and show permit requirement notes when blocked.
- Tests for permit issuance/acceptance and permit expiry.

## Non-Goals
- No smuggling-specific passes or permit trading.
- No faction-specific permit tiers or permanent licenses.
- No new contract types beyond permit gating.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add permit model/storage and decrement expiry on institution ticks.
2. Wire Harbor Master permit issuance action with high-impact budget usage.
3. Allow emergency acceptance when a permit is active; surface requirement in contract cards.
4. Update dashboard/institutions UI for permit status and permit listings.
5. Add tests for permit issuance/acceptance and expiry.

## Review Notes
- Verify permits expire on ticks and are removed cleanly.
- Ensure emergency contracts can’t be accepted without rep/permit, but work with permits.
- Confirm permit UI renders for both dashboard and institutions fragments.
