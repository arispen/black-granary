# v0.13.0 Plan

Goal: extend information warfare with scrying dossiers and polish intel UX.

## Feature: Scrying Reports
- Add a high-impact “Scry Target” intel action that captures a short-lived snapshot of a target.
- Store reports with location, travel status, heat/rep, and resource counts.
- Expire reports after a few ticks; scrying is blocked by active rite wards.

## UX + Balance
- Surface scry reports in the Intel panel with clear expiry info.
- Ensure publish evidence only consumes high-impact budget when evidence exists.

## QA
- Add tests for scry report expiry and for evidence publish budget consumption.
- Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-cache go test ./...`.
