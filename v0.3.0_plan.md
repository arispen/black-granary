# v0.3.0 Plan — Market & Relief Loop

## Goals
- Add a market loop that ties scarcity to player stockpiles and gold.
- Let players convert stockpiles into visible civic relief outcomes.
- Improve UX clarity when no other players are available for intel/loans.

## Scope
1. Market prices derived from grain tier, policy tax, and market controls.
2. Player stockpile (sacks), buy/sell actions, and relief donation.
3. UI card for Market + stockpile visibility in the standing panel.
4. Disable intel/loan actions when there are no other players.
5. Tests for market transactions and new fragment polling.

## Out of Scope
- Inventory items beyond grain sacks.
- Multi-location pricing or market travel.
- Persistent storage beyond in-memory.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Market actions could destabilize grain tiers too quickly.
  - Mitigate by keeping sacks small relative to world supply and limiting trade size.
- UI clutter in the sidebar.
  - Keep market panel compact and surface max buy/sell hints.

## Release Checklist
- Update release notes.
- Bump VERSION to 0.3.0.
- Tests pass.
- Tag v0.3.0 and merge with master.

## Review
- The plan adds a new gameplay loop (market + relief) without expanding infrastructure.
- The design connects existing systems (scarcity, policy, unrest) in a readable way.
- Scope is small enough to ship in one iteration while still delivering a feature release.
