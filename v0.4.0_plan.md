# v0.4.0 Plan — Law & Bounty Loop

## Goals
- Turn Heat into visible legal pressure with a Wanted tier.
- Generate bounty contracts targeting high-heat players.
- Require evidence to close bounties, reinforcing the intel loop.
- Surface heat levels and bounty requirements in the UI.

## Scope
1. Wanted thresholds and heat labels (Noticed/Watched/Wanted/Hunted).
2. Bounty contracts issued for active Wanted players.
3. Evidence-gated bounty delivery with target penalties and hunter rewards.
4. Contract UI shows target + bounty requirements; stance selector hidden for bounties.
5. Players list shows Heat and labels; market inputs guard against zero max values.

## Out of Scope
- Full law zones, travel, or patrol encounters.
- Jail time or faction-specific legal systems.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Bounties could spam the board.
  - Limit to one active bounty per target and only for recently active players.
- Evidence availability could stall bounty completion.
  - Allow accepting bounties before evidence is acquired; display the requirement clearly.

## Release Checklist
- Update release notes.
- Bump VERSION to 0.4.0.
- Tests pass.
- Tag v0.4.0 and merge with master.
