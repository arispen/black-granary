# v0.18.0 Plan

## Goals
- Make bribes grant temporary corrupt access that bypasses permits and embargoes.
- Surface bribed access status and embargo requirements in the contract UI.
- Tighten travel lockout UX on dashboard actions and add test coverage.

## Plan
1. Add bribed access ticks to players, decrement on ticks, and grant via `bribe_official`.
2. Allow bribed access to bypass emergency permit and smuggling embargo checks, with UI requirement notes.
3. Update dashboard standing/action controls and add tests; bump version and release notes.

## Review Checklist
- Bribed access expires on ticks and bypasses permit/embargo checks only while active.
- Contract cards show embargo/permit requirements (and bribed access when relevant).
- Dashboard actions disable properly while traveling.
